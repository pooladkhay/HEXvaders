## HEXvaders

As soon as you see an invader, convert its hexadecimal value to binary and flip the bits using numbers 1 through 8 on your keyboard. Once the bit pattern matches the hex value of an invader, it gets shot. Remember, don't let the invaders reach the shooter line!

This is the terminal implementation of [Flippy Bit And The Attack Of The Hexadecimals From Base 16](https://flippybitandtheattackofthehexadecimalsfrombase16.com).
